Hi All, I tried looking for an answer for my specific TV model, however I couldn't find one. I also read online that the support for 4K from DLNA is based on the firmware for the model of the TV: https://superuser.com/questions/880245/does-dlna-support-4k-resolution-video I recently purchased a 65" Samsung NU8000 UHD TV, and I enabled DLNA through Windows 10 on my desktop PC. I was wondering if casting to the smart tv was really UHD. Any info is greatly appreciated, and I can clarify I'm trying to secure my network and keep "smart" isolated. My set up is as below br0 (LAN) - only trusted devices - this has my media center (kodi on ubuntu) (`htpc`, 192.168.1.4) running. Also runs a samba server as a file share. br1(LAN1) - untrusted - has my smart TV (172.16.0.2) I'd like to be able to access Kodi from my smart TV over upnp/DLNA. It's just a smart tv - so I have the Kodi app on it and have configured `htpc` as a uPNP server. BEfore I setup VLANs all was hunky dory. 
I am looking for an option to play files from my network SMB drive on my LG TV with WebOS. I have looked all through the app store options with no luck. I do not wan to run a PLEX server. amp#x200B; I saw a thread in this sub asking the same question 3 years ago, but it was never answered. I set my Win 10 PC as a DLNA server using Windows Media player. Oculus Gallery can detect my PC and see my media folders, but when I click on any given folder, it says no media found. These are mp4 videos. Have no problems with Skybox connecting and seeing media files over 5ghz wifi. Any thoughts? Skybox is ok, but it seems Oculus Gallery plays back internal videos more smoothly with less judder, so I would like to use that instead for viewing my pc videos. I am looking for something like what videostream extension do for chromecast. Thanks. ( is an open source DLNA server that runs on Windows/Mac/Linux https://skybox.xyz/ (https://skybox.xyz/download/) is supposedly the best DLNA player on the Oculus Go right now. It sort of works and starts playing the video ok, but whenever I try to skip forward or backwards in the video SkyBox VR says "unknown error" and then crashes. Has anyone tried to get this combination to work on Oculus Hi guys! amp#x200B; So a few years ago, I read some guide and managed to set up a home network. This allowed me to access my laptop from my TV, browse to the shared folder, and directly play video or audio files. amp#x200B; For some reason, I can't figure out how to do it again. I've spent a lot of time googling, and I keep reading that home networking / homegroup or something has been taken out of windows 10. What I have to do now is copy the files onto USB drive Just installed Linux Mint Mate 19 on my laptop , and I would like to stream my movies stored on the same laptop to my LG smart TV  The TV is connected to my home wireless router via an Ethernet cable as is my laptop  I am looking for a way to watch my films on the LG Smart TV , but as my internet connection is not very reliable , what ever I use ( Media server app ) my not be able to connect to the internet  Is there a way I can watch my films stored on my laptop , on my LG Smart TV but witho. I'm looking for suggestions on how to setup a home network that will consist of a couple of laptops, a stationary pc, 2 smart phones, a smart tv, wifi router with usb harddrives. I want to be able to access files, download and stream video across all units. There seems to be a lot of options; samba, sshfs, nextcloud, setting up a fileserver, kodi, etc but i'm not really sure what would be the best option. 
Hi All, Anyone running Plex on a windows docker host? Everything works except DLNA doesn't get advertised on my network. Any ideas. As far as I can tell, both my laptop and my TV should be certified for it. However, when I try, the TV responds, but after a bit of loading comes to the conclusion that "file can not be read or found", Meanwhile, the "cast to device" windows program says there's an "Unexpected device error". amp#x200B; I tried a mkv, mp4 and avi video - all the same. amp#x200B; Any advice? amp#x200B; Edit: Slight correction, it's a \ 49\ PUS8303.

Newbie here. from 2 IPs in my LAN my firewall log only has alot of alerts only from these two IPs. 192.168.10.1:1901 239.255.255.250:1900 UDP 192.168.10.12:56839 239.255.255.250:1900 UDP 192.168.10.12:38184 239.255.255.250:1900 UDP 192.168.10.1 = Cisco EPC3940AD EuroDocsis 3.0 2-PORT Voice Gateway ( ISP ) 192.168.10.12 = PFsense. How can I disable this alert I know almost nothing about NAS, but here's what I want to do: I have about a TB of FLAC files, plus a lesser amount of movies, that I store on a WD red hard drive on my computer. That hard drive is backed up to a second WD red internal hard drive. I have a another hard drive hooked up via USB to my DAC/Preamp (OPPO BDP\-105). That contains copies of the music and movies. That drive is controlled via the oppo remote on the TV screen. I have to physically disconnet the hard drive and bring. Hello everyone, I have a Plex server installed on my computer, accessible on my local network. I try to access films on the server from another PC with Windows 10. I go to the Windows file explorer and go in "This PC --gt Network locations --gt Plex Media Server". I see my films it's ok so far but when I try to play one of them with VLC it downloads it instead of reading it from the server. I also tried with this path in the file explorer : "Networks --gt Media Device --gt Plex Media. </p>
