GPT fdisk is a disk partitioning tool loosely modeled on Linux fdisk, but used for modifying GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks. The related FixParts utility fixes some common problems on Master Boot Record (MBR) disks. Скажу сразу — о фиче, позволяющей использовать почтовый ящик Гугла в качестве виртуального диска в Windows (в том числе под Линуксом и Мac) известно чуть ли не с далекого 2004 года. GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk, cgdisk, sgdisk, and fixparts programs) is a set of text-mode partitioning tools for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows. The gdisk, cgdisk, and sgdisk programs work on Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than on the older (and once more common) Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables. Hello all. I have a simple network storage system with a boot drive and two large storage drives. Originally it had just one drive and everything was hunky dory until I added the second drive, which was previously an external backup. I ran fdisk -l to look at the newly added drive and saw errors on both disks. I remember something like "GPT PMBR size mismatch" and it telling me to use the write command in gdisk. After looking up similar things on the internet it seemed like running the write.

Introduction gDisk is a software that turns your GMail account into a portable hard drive so you can always have your important files accessible accross the Internet. I'm trying to manage a disk I connected to my router but somehow the filesystem isn't recognized, to reformat the disk I'll need parted, but my repository does not provide. Немного теории.

 A gdisk Walkthrough by Rod Smith, rodsmith@rodsbooks.com Last Web page update: 7/5/2018, referencing GPT fdisk version 1.0.4. This Web page, and the associated software, is provided free of charge and with no annoying outside ads; however, I did take time to prepare it, and Web hosting does cost money. Just scored a 0 on ex200. I struggled with partitioning despite having it down pretty well in all of my labbing. Received the “booting from hard disk” error after a final reboot and I assume my machine couldn’t boot at all. A few questions: 1) Can I retake the exam at anytime, or is there a wait period? 2) Does a retake cost the full 0 again? 3) Anyone have experience with the above error? I assume I either messed up partition sizing or the grub boot info on disk somehow.

Hello, I'm having a hell of a time getting Arch to install on my laptop. Everything that I've read and tried doesn't work. I've tried installing it as UEFI/GPT partition and BIOS/MBR partition, and neither will work. I just keep getting the same message ( https://imgur.com/phvxZjG (https://imgur.com/phvxZjG)) when I reboot my laptop after finishing the installation guide. So I'm seeing if anyone can help me out.

I had a 120 GB SSD that I clone to a 500GB SSD using clonezilla. First time using it and it partition off 120 GB from my 500GB SSD for it, which I understand. However when I go to computer management and try to extend it for the rest of the remaining 500GB its not there. What do I do? https://imgur.com/0HTe60Y I tried diskpart in CMD but that didn't work. Also I already took out the 120GB SSD out of my computer, and its sitting here right in-front of me. thank you for your time. For futur.

Situation: You want an introduction to using the GDisk switches. Solution: GDisk is a DOS program with seven main operations. This document describes the options available for each operation. Need some help with a harddrive that I messed up. I used an external SATA-gtusb converter to plug my new 6tb hard drive into my Ubuntu laptop. Fdisk and gparted both showed it as just under 2TB. In an attempt to fix that, I used gparted to give it a new GPT. Still showed as just under 2TB. I then installed it into my server (thinking the SATA-gtUSB converter was limiting the usable space for some reason) and my server refused to boot, and failed over to the Ubuntu recovery mode (CLI).

They work on Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than on the older (and once more common) Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables. 
Do I download a Mac ISO and burn it to a USB and re install? I know with Windows, registration keys are burned into the BIOS, so reinstalling Windows is just a matter of re installation. amp#x200B; But Ive never done it with a Mac, or more specifically So guys, I have 8 disks that are multipathed. I have configured mpathd and I now have /dev/mapper/mpath volumes I can format and use. My goal is/was to format them with Linux RAID fd00 with gdisk and then use mdadm to create a raid. All pretty standard stuff, but alas I have got a bit confused! So gdisk worked fine, but I thought I would end up with for example /dev/mapper/mpatha1 but instead that hasn't changed but in /proc/partitions I see: 8 112 7814026584 Hi. I am trying to create a boot partition under Arch Linux with fdisk. However, typing 'g' the bootable option ('a') is no longer available. systemd-boot says it will not work unless I have a GPT partition table but how can I make it bootable then? is it possible to do it in one program alone? Many thanks for reading and hoping for an answer. 
Yeah I know, Arch . But I've been meaning on playing around with it and I'm at my mind's end trying to figure out an error I am getting when using gdisk to create new partitions for the system. I can't find any help via documentation or I might've misunderstood. Whenever I go ahead and use gdisk /dev/sda then continue with adding a new partition and skipping the first sector, I have an issue where I can't create any sized partition, in this case it being +2G when trying I installed W10 to its own drive, made the stupid mistake of assuming it would write its bootloader there instead of Disk 0. Long story short, I ended up with a screwed EFI partition. Things are working again, but there's one slight (non-?)issue. I'm in a bit of a loop (note that I've been buried in this for ages, there are a couple of permutations of errors from `fsck`, but the core loop is identical): 1. Everything works perfectly. However `gdisk /{efi_partition}` states main 'GPT header. Ubuntu server 14.01 hyper-v VM a while back i organized an outage of a server to convert it from MBR to GPT as i was needing to extend a data drive to 2.2TiB and i knew i was about to hit the limitation of MBR and would need to extend the drive again in the future. Now is that time, i have extended the VHDX to 2850GB as seen below, now i expected to be able to delete recreate to expand the drive but it seems that protective MBR is what is still restricting me from going past 2.2TiB Going to install later and I’m a little confused on partitioning through the command line. I have an EFI file system and a partition with ubuntu that I’ll swap with arch. This is enough for a root install, but I may want to create more partitions possibly. Here are my questions: 1. If I create a new partition, is this automatically assigned to unallocated space? If all space is allocated, what happens if I create a new partition? 2. Do I only need to mount to a previously existing efi partitio. 
Hi, I am new to archlinux and am trying to setup archlinux. Due to a couple of detours during installation attempts, currently i am going through my third time of wiping out and re-partitioning (and i expect much more to come ;)). While I was going through, I've noticed list of selections when you F12 to booting menu had been increasing with additional 'Linux Boot Manager', although the one connected to previous installation does not work. I've searched ways to remove this entry and found. Im extremly sorry for the spamming, but I've already spend many hours installing arch, and I have a problem, that may force me to start from scratch. I wrote: bootctl --path=/boot install But it says that it isn't on a gpt partition table. /boot is on /dev/sda1 When creating the partition I didn't see how to chose gpt. I saw how to convert from mbr to gpt using sgdisk -g /dev/sda But it says thet sgdisk is not found. What can I do? Should I was happy as a clam when I was able to install Mint 18.3 on my new HP 530-131 gaming desktop -- onto an SSD (leaving Windows on the HDD alone). No BIOS changes. Secure boot enabled. Everything cool. Installed Steam and graphics worked fine. Upgraded kernel to 4.15 to get sound working fine. But I was annoyed that the wifi chip (RTL8188?) was not being detected, so I opted to restore the BIOS settings back to factory state in case some upgrade (by previous owner) had done something. DISASTER!. I'm running a small lab with several Dell PE2950III's, and a tray of 15TB SAS. I have one dedicated to NAS, and two running VMs under vsphere 6. I've recently got a new server, an IBM x3550 M4 with dual E5-2680's and 64gb RAM, so I'm thinking I'd like to consolidate all three Dell's into that one IBM. What are your thoughts on a converged solution? One option is to run 9.10.3 on the x3550, and use bhyve as my hypervisor. Is bhyve mature enough to reliably run my dozen or so VMs (Windows. (Sorry if I sound panicked right now, because I am) The tale of the newbie executing a dangerous command and accidentally bricking his system may sound familiar, I just didn't think that I would be that guy. I had installed Arch and was looking to fix a booting issue by reinstalling Grub. I booted using a live usb but couldn't mount /dev/sda (the hard drive) which contains the system partitions and lots of backed-up media files. Not having been seriously burned before (or at least didn't. Looks like I got some issues guys. My c740 with Win10 started crashing yesterday. It was in MS Word and things got weird. It seemed like the system was stalling and some things working like the mouse pointer but when I put it back on MS Word the pointer disappeared. It finally crashed, I took a pic of the screen that popped up after it crashed. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6zTckTRAQ5UFRaWHhEeG9sZTA/view?usp=sharing Since then it has crashed at least a half dozen more time. 
Hello there. I am a long-time Ubuntu user, and that is what I am currently running. I've been playing around with Antergos lately in a virtual machine, and have decided that I really like the underlying distro for its up-to-date packages, rolling release, pacman, the AUR, etc. As a result, I am interested in switching from Ubuntu to Arch, but I want to do it The Arch Way™ instead of just using Antergos. I'd like to learn and understand everything better. Now, I've read through i've mounted a 16gb usb drive to my raspi. i formated it to ext3. for some reason when i check the disk size it shows it's only 190mb. what am i doing wrong.
